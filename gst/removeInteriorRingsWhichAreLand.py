    """Remove the holes in a shape which match land

    This function reads in a shape and a list of Polygons of land masses. Each
    Polygon of land is compared with each hole in the shape and a new shape is
    made which does not have any holes which match a land mass.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon, shapely.geometry.multipolygon.MultiPolygon
        the input shape
    lands : list of shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon
        the list of land masses
    onlyValid : bool, optional
        only return valid Polygons (checks for validity can take a while, if
        being called often)
    repair : bool, optional
        attempt to repair invalid Polygons
    tol : float, optional
        the Euclidean distance that defines two points as being the same (in
        degrees)

    Returns
    -------
    shape : shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon, shapely.geometry.multipolygon.MultiPolygon
        the output shape
