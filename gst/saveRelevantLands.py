    Given a ship and a sailing distance, save a compressed WKB file of all of
    the possible land (surveyed from a list of Polygons) that the ship may
    encounter whilst sailing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wName : string
        the file name of the compressed WKB file
    ship : shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon, shapely.geometry.multipolygon.MultiPolygon
        the ship to sail
    dist : float
        the distance to sail the ship by
    allLands : list of shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon
        a list of Polygons of land to sail the ship around
    debug : bool, optional
        print debug messages
    fill : float, optional
        how many intermediary points are added to fill in the straight lines
        which connect the points; negative values disable filling
    fillSpace : str, optional
        the geometric space to perform the filling in (either "EuclideanSpace"
        or "GeodesicSpace")
    nAng : int, optional
        the number of angles around each point that are calculated when
        buffering
    simp : float, optional
        how much intermediary [Multi]Polygons are simplified by; negative values
        disable simplification (in degrees)
    tol : float, optional
        the Euclidean distance that defines two points as being the same (in
        degrees)
